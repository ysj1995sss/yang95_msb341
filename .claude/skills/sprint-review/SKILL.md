description: Close a sprint by reviewing what actually happened. Finds the Claude Code sessions and commits from the sprint window, asks which projects belonged to this sprint, and writes sprints/sprint-N-review.md summarizing when the work happened, where it got stuck, and which builder axis it advanced. Use at the end of every sprint, or when the user says "review my sprint", "close out my sprint", or "/sprint-review".

# Sprint Review

Read what actually happened over the last two weeks and write it up. The report is for the
builder first: it is usually more accurate about where the time went than memory is.

Run `scripts/sprint_scan.py` in this skill's directory to do the reading. It never sends
anything anywhere.

## Steps

### 1. Establish the sprint and its window

Find the highest `sprints/sprint-N-plan.md`. That is this sprint. Read it: the goal, why, done
looks like, predicted difficulty.

The window starts at the plan file's first commit and ends now:

```bash
git log --diff-filter=A --format=%aI -- sprints/sprint-N-plan.md | tail -1
```

If the plan file was never committed, say so plainly. That costs them points and they should
know now rather than at grading. Use the last 14 days as the window and continue.

### 2. Find candidate sessions

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/sprint_scan.py --since <ISO date> --list
```

This lists every Claude Code project directory with session activity in the window: the
decoded working directory, the session count, and first and last activity. It reads filenames
and timestamps only, not session content.

### 3. Ask which projects belonged to this sprint

Show the list. Pre-select any whose path is at or under this repo, and any whose name relates
to the goal in the plan. Present the rest unselected.

Ask once: which of these were this sprint's work?

**Read nothing until they answer.** If they exclude a directory, do not ask why and do not
name it in the report. Record only the count of excluded sessions.

### 4. Read the confirmed sessions

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/sprint_scan.py --since <ISO date> --projects <path> [<path> ...] --analyze
```

You get back per-day activity, session count and duration, the user's own prompts, and tool
usage counts. Also read the git log for the window.

### 5. Work out what happened

- **When they worked.** Which days, and whether it was spread or bunched.
- **Where they got stuck.** Look for runs of prompts circling one problem: repeated retries,
  rephrasing, error text pasted back. Name the two or three biggest, and say how each ended.
- **What took the most time.** By session duration and prompt volume, not by commit count.
- **Which axis this advanced.** Pick exactly one, from the work itself rather than from what
  they intended:
  - **Agentic Workflow**: directing the agent, CLAUDE.md, slash commands, subagents, specs
  - **Discovery**: users, interviews, problem framing, validation, positioning research
  - **Design**: interface, layout, flow, usability, responsive work
  - **Application Architecture**: data, auth, APIs, deployment, tests, refactoring
  - **AI Systems**: model calls in the product, prompts in the product, evals
  - **Launch and Learn**: landing pages, acquisition, pricing, analytics, metrics
  If it is genuinely split, name the one with the most time and say so.

### 6. Write the report

Write `sprints/sprint-N-review.md`:

```markdown
# Sprint N Review

**Window:** <start> to <end>
**Sessions reviewed:** N across M projects (X sessions excluded at your request)

## When you worked

<days active out of 14, and the shape: spread, bunched, front-loaded, one long push>

## Where you got stuck

<the two or three real ones, and how each ended>

## What took the most time

<by session time and prompt volume>

## Axis

**<axis>.** <one sentence on why, from the work>

## Against your plan

**Goal was:** <from the plan file>
<Does the work match the goal? Say it plainly either way.>
```

Facts, not encouragement. No praise, no coaching, no suggestions for next time. The builder
draws the conclusions in their retro.

### 7. Hand off to the retro

Tell them to read the report, then add to the plan file:

```markdown
**Actual difficulty:** 1 to 5.

**Why it differed:** One sentence.

**Retro:** Did you hit the goal? If not, what happened? What changes next sprint?
```

Then commit both:

```bash
git add sprints/ && git commit -m "Sprint N review and retro" && git push
```

## Rules

- Never read a project the user did not confirm.
- Never copy transcript text into the report. Summarize.
- Never name an excluded project. Report the count only.
- If no sessions are found, say so and write the report from git alone.
